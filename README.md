There are two files in this repository: Ragam Manipulator, and Assorted Other Functions.

Ragam Manipulator deals with concepts from Carnatic music, classical music from south India. In Carnatic music, Ragams (scales) are usually always sung in one key. However, very skilled musicians can do Gruha Bedam, which is transposing a ragam to another key and creating a different ragam entirely. This is a very complex process, and the Ragam Manipulator can do this, as it takes a premade database of every ragam there is and returns a list of every transformation of those ragams. For more information on Gruha Bedams: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graha_bhedam

Assorted Other Functions is a compilation of numerous other functions I made in scheme for various purposes. These include combinatorics, calculating roots of any function, and numerically calculating the value of trig functions for any angle (cos, sin, etc.) from first principles.
